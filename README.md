# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software Engineering can be defined as a systemic application of
priciples, methods and tools to the development and maintenance
of high-quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engimeering is a process of applying some primciples, methods
amd tools to develop software, but traditional programming involves writing
of codes in a programming language, compiling and interpreting them,
or simply programming is a set of instruction

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Software Development Life Cycle..Are models used in the development of software by following various 
steps
1.Requirments: Simply means what the user needs, documenting it
2.Design: This has to do with designing how you want the software architecture
and user interface to look like
3.Implementation: This is writing the code and building the software according
to the design specifications.
4.Testing: This is ensuring the software meets standards and function well
5.Deployment: Is releasing the software to the client or user
6.Maintenance: Means continuous updating the software

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
1.Waterfall: Is a sequential approach with distinct phases(e.g,requirement,
design and implementation) flowing downwards.is for shot term project
2.Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexilibility, 
collaboration and responding to change. is for long term project.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering simply means getting the necessary information,
documentation, and having a proper guidelines on developing a software,
it is important  in software development because it gives us the view
on what needs to be design and how to go about it.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design simply means dividing the software into different components while designing, with this it is easy to main in the case of maintanabilty and also for growth of the software in the case of scalabilty, e.g, in the case of a house which different components that has been divided, with that the house can be easiliy maintained and function well

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1.Unit testing in software engineering focuses on individual components(methods, functions)
2.Integration testing has to do with checking the components are working
3.System testing is making sure whole system is working
4.Accpetance testing can be described as when the system meets the user demand

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control System refers to the process of tracking and managing
changes to digital assests over time, it is important because it enables
teams to track changes to code,e.g Git( Can be used to solve problems 
and sending it to github) Subversion

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software
project
Challenges faced in managing a software include 1. Unestablished project
infrastructure. 2. Keeping up with changing requirements 3. Quality assurance

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance has to do with continous updating of the software and adding new features when necessary, this will help in prolonging the usage of the software.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1.Software Engineers should consider or avoid their work being misused
2.They should not be biased in their work
3.Take accountability
3.Act as a respected citizen

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
